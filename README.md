# Findbugs plugin annotation

This is an Annotation Processor to generate XML files for Findbugs Plugin.
Currently this Annotation Processor can generate `findbugs.xml`, and will support `messages.xml` in near future.


## Motivation

Findbugs plugin is awesome: it can add more detectors to find problem by static analysis.

But it's little troublesome to develop, because we need to make complex XML files and package them to .jar file. I hope that annotation processing can be help to reduce this trouble.


# How to use

Depend on this plugin, and annotate your custom detectors with `@Detector` annotation.
Refer [SampleDetector.java](src/test/resources/SampleDetector.java) in test as example.

It is also recommended to put one `@FindbugsPlugin` annotation to `package-info.java`,
then your `findbugs.xml` can provide detailed information like plugin provider.
Refer [package-info.java](src/test/resources/jp/skypencil/test/package-info.java) in test as example.

To use this annotation processor by Maven, please add following XML snippet to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>jp.skypencil.findbugs</groupId>
    <artifactId>findbugs-plugin-annotation</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <optional>true</optional>
  </dependency>
```
